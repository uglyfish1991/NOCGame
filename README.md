# Seafloor Scramble

Seafloor scramble is my first Unity game made outside of my Unity Bootcamp. It is an educational game, based on controlling the National Oceanography Centre's ROV Isis to pick up the requested samples from the sea floor. It is aimed at players aged 5 - 11 (flexible based on reading skill - some 5 year olds will find it easy, some 11 year olds will find it challenging, but that's the general range.)

The game is to demonstrate **how technology is used to help support conservation**, and **what insights do we get from studying these samples** - it's not necessarily about what creatures or samples are down in the deep ocean.

It is still a work in progress. ==There is still a lot of work to be done.==

## To - Do List (Improvements)

- [ ] **Weight/space limit** - representitive of the real ROV
- [ ] **Animations** - would look more exciting if the creatures walked!
- [ ] **Sound FX** - could support with accessiblity if sound can help hint at pick ups

## To - Do List (Fixes)

- [ ] Sometimes you can't pick up after a collision
- [ ] Swap to new input system for touch screen support!
- [ ] Clean up code - some old references aren't needed
- [ ] The ROV art needs improving
- [ ] The background loop is weird?
