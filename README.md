#Seafloor Scramble

Seafloor scramble is my first Unity game made outside of my Unity Bootcamp. It is an educational game, based on controlling the National Oceanography Centre's ROV Isis to pick up the requested samples from the sea floor. 

The game is to demonstrate how technology is used to help support conservation, and what information can be found out from the samples - it's not necessarily about what creatures or samples are down in the deep.

It is written in C#, using Unity 6. It uses the old input system, which SHOULD be changed.

It is still a work in progress. There is still a lot of work to be done.
