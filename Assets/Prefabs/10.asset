  description: I can't wait to analyse this sulphide deposit!\n\nSulphide deposits
    are piles of shiny, dark minerals that form near hydrothermal vents. They contain
    metals like copper and gold. \n\nBy studying sulphide deposits, we can learn
    more about where important metals come from and how they form under the sea!
