  description: "You've picked up an amphipod swarm!\\n\\nAmphipods are tiny shrimp-like
    creatures that swim together in big groups called swarms. Even though they\u2019re
    small, they\u2019re very important in the ocean food chain. \\n\\nBy studying
    amphipod swarms, we can learn more about how deep-sea animals find food and survive
    in the dark ocean!"
